To run, use the standalone py.test binary, pytest.py:
    
    ./pytest.py

Alternatively, you can install py.test and use it:

To install py.test:

    easy_install -U pytest

Install your your ssh keys for booting VMs:
   
    nova keypair-add --pub_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub `whoami`

If running the test from outside the openstack cluster, the default
group needs to be configured to allow icmp and ssh traffic to VMs:

    nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
    nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0

Run with py.test:

    py.test --guest_key_name=`whoami` --capture=no -vvv

For the brave & well (cluster) endowed:

    easy_install -U pytest-xdist && py.test -n 6

The above command will fork and run 6 test in parallel. Because of increased
load, latency increases and some test operations will timeout. YMMV.

Run py.test --help to see the configuration options. You can change which hosts
the test runs on, for instance, with
    
    py.test --hosts=node1,node2

To make using py.test less tedious, store your favourite command-line options in
pytest.ini. Here's mine:

    $ cat pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    addopts=--hosts=node1,node2 -vvv --capture=no

-- A note on ssh keys

To run some tests, you will need a key installed on the physical hosts as well.
The user is controlled by the --host_user option, and the key is set by the
--host_key_path option.

This user should either be root, or have passwordless sudo access.
