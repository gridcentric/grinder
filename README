To run, use the standalone py.test binary, pytest.py:
    
    ./pytest.py

Alternatively, you can install py.test and use it:

To install py.test:

    easy_install -U pytest

To install the openstack-test key in your Openstack project:
    
    nova keypair-add --pub_key openstack-test.pub openstack-test

Change permissions on the private half of the key to appease ssh:
    
    chown me:me openstack-test.key
    chmod 600 openstack-test.key

If running the test from outside the openstack cluster, the default
group needs to be configured to allow icmp and ssh traffic to VMs:
    
    nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
    nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0

Run with py.test:

    py.test --capture=no -vvv

For the brave & well (cluster) endowed:

    easy_install -U pytest-xdist && py.test -n 6

The above command will fork and run 6 test in parallel. Because of increased
load, latency increases and some test operations will timeout. YMMV.

Run py.test --help to see the configuration options. You can change which hosts
the test runs on, for instance, with
    
    py.test --hosts=node1,node2
