To install py.test:

    easy_install -U pytest

Run with py.test:

    py.test --capture=no -vvv

For the brave & well (cluster) endowed:

    easy_install -U pytest-xdist && py.test -n 6

The above command will fork and run 6 test in parallel. Because of increased
load, latency increases and some test operations will timeout. YMMV.
